Building on the work of van de Leemput et al., this study aims to extend their deterministic model of multiple interacting feedbacks by incorporating stochastic events, such as
extreme weather, which are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change.
Extreme weather events, including cyclones and marine heatwaves, can cause sudden and
severe disruptions to coral reefs. By integrating stochastic disturbances
into the feedback model, we can begin understanding how stochastic events interact with
these feedback mechanisms and predict the conditions under which coral reefs might shift
from a coral-dominated state to an alternate state, such as macroalgae dominance.
